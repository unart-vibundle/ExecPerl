This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=281

Provides the following commands:

:ExecPerl script_name
	This will execute script_name using the perl
	interpreter.

:ExecPerlMore
	This will execute script_name using the perl
	interpreter.  If the output would scroll past the end
	of the screen, execution pauses and waits for a
	keystroke before continuing.

:ExecPerlDump
	This will ask you for an output file and then
	execute script_name using the perl interpreter.  The
	output from the script is dumped to the file that you
	entered when you were prompted.  You may press enter
	instead of entering a file name to accept the default
	filename.

Also, The following keys are mapped by default.  You'll have to
comment them if you don't want this behavior:

	<F5>:    ExecPerl the current file being edited
	<C-F5>:  ExecPerlMore the current file being edited
	<S-F5>:  ExecPerlDump the current file being edited
